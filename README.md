# Level 2 – Task 1: Predictive Modeling (Regression)

## Internship
Codveda Technologies – Data Science Internship

## Objective
Build and evaluate regression models to predict a continuous target variable (house prices) using a company-provided dataset.

## Dataset
- File: `house Prediction Data Set.csv`
- Type: Numerical dataset (housing data)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Workflow
1. Loaded the dataset and assigned appropriate column names.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Trained multiple regression models:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
4. Evaluated models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
5. Compared model performance.

## Results
- Linear Regression: Baseline performance
- Decision Tree: Improved accuracy over linear regression
- Random Forest: Best performance with lowest MSE and highest R² score

## Conclusion
Random Forest Regression provided the most accurate predictions among the tested models, making it the best choice for this dataset.
